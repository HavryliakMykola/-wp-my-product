This plugin adds custom functionality to WooCommerce to allow users to add and manage their own products through their account page. The plugin adds two new endpoints to the WooCommerce account menu: Add Product and My Products.

Features
Add Product: Allows logged-in users to add a new product to their store, with fields for name, price, quantity, description (WYSIWYG editor), and image upload.
My Products: Displays a list of products added by the logged-in user, with options to view, edit, or delete the products.
Media Library Filtering: Ensures that users can only access media files that they have uploaded.
WooCommerce Integration: Works seamlessly with WooCommerce, including stock management, product status, and catalog visibility.
Activation Check: Ensures WooCommerce is active before the plugin can be activated.
